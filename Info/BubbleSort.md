# **BUBBLE SORT**
  ## **INTRO**
  Bubble sort is one of ***MANY*** sorting algorithms you will learn about as a programmer, it is also one of the first. Bubble Sort is considered to be one of the simplest algorithms, so it makes for a great start! While this is not an algotithms course, we don't want you to have a stroke when you get there, so it's best to dip your feet in now before you meet QuickSort.

Before explaning what Bubble Sort do, I need to get a few technical bits out of the way:
- Like most sorts, Bubble Sort can sort a list in either ascending or descending order
  - For the purposes of this _thing_ we will be doing the former
- Bubble Sort is an ***in place*** sort
  - This means that it does **not** create a new list or array, it simply modifies the one it's given
- Bubble Sort is **SLOW** with an emphesis on **SLOW**
  - I will explain why in the [Optimization](#OPTIMIZATION) section, along with some improvements we can make

  Like most all sorts, bubble sort can work in both directions, producing a ascending or descending list, for the purposes of this explanation, we will be doing the former.

  ## **WHAT DO?**
Bubble sort is quite simple and works with two loops, an **innter** and **outer** loop.
  ### **Inner Loop**
  The inner loop is the meat and potatoes of the sort, pretty much all of the logic happens here. The main goal of this loop is to move the maximum value to one end of the array. (
  ### **Outer Loop**
